    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinatorics\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory of counting is known as **combinatorics**. It deals with counting the number of ways that an event can occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main approach taken involves simplifying the solution by decomposing the problem into smaller parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The product rule\n",
    "\n",
    "If a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks, and there are $n_1$ ways to do the first task, and $n_2$ ways to do the second task, then the total number of ways to complete the procedure is $n_1 n_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be generalised to:\n",
    " -  If a sequence of tasks $T_1,T_2,\\dots ,T_m$ can be done in $n_1,n_2, \\dots, n_m$ ways respectively, and every task arrives after the occurrence of the previous task, then there are $n_1 \\cdot n_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_m$ ways to perform the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The sum rule\n",
    "\n",
    "If a procedure requires only one of two independent tasks to be completed, and there are $n_1$ ways to do the first task, and $n_2$ ways to do the second task, then the total number of ways to complete the procedure is $n_1 + n_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be generalised to:\n",
    " -  If a sequence of tasks $T_1,T_2,\\dots ,T_m$ can be done in $n_1,n_2, \\dots, n_m$ ways respectively (with no tasks being performed simultaneously), then there are $n_1 + n_2 + \\ldots + n_m$ ways to perform one of the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The product rule is used when the sub-tasks of an event are dependent on one another (each of them is perfomred); the sum rule is used when they are independent (only one of them is performed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion-exclusion principle\n",
    "\n",
    "If two tasks can be performed at the same time, there is a possibility of overcounting, since some ways may be counted twice. To prevent this:\n",
    " - We add the number of ways to perform each task\n",
    " - Then subtract the number of ways to do both tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. An ordered arrangement of $r$ objects is called an $r$-permutation. \n",
    " - ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA are all the unique 3-permutations of the set {A,B,C}\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of $r$-permuations for a set of $n$ distinct elements is given by:\n",
    "$$ P(n,r) = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\cdots \\times (n-r+1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be expressed more simply in factorial form:\n",
    "$$ P(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula assumes all objects in the set are distinct. If the set contains $n$ objects, of which $n_1$ are of one type (indistinguishable from each other), $n_2$ are of a second type, $n_k$ are of a $k_th$ type, so that $n = n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k$, then the number of distinct permutations is given by:\n",
    "$$ P(n;n_1,n_2,\\cdots,n_k) = \\frac{n!}{{n_1}!{n_2}!\\cdots{n_k}!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination is an unordered arrangement of objects. An unordered arrangement of $r$ objects is called an $r$-combination. \n",
    " - While $a,b$ and $b,a$ would be unique permutations, they represent the same combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of $r$-combinations for a set of $n$ distinct elements is given by:\n",
    "$$ C(n,r) = {n \\choose r} = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)! \\, r!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of unordered objects.\n",
    "The size, or cardinality, of a set $L$, $|L|$, is the number of elements in the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "For two sets $L$ and $R$, the basic set operations are:\n",
    " - Union: $L \\cup R$ - the set of elements in $L$ or $R$ or both\n",
    " - Intersection: $L \\cap R$ - the set of elements in both $L$ and $R$\n",
    " - Complement: $\\overline{L}$ - all the elements not in $L$\n",
    " - Set Difference/Subtract: $L - R$ - elements in $L$ that are not in $R$\n",
    " - Subset: $L \\subseteq S$ - every element of $L$ is also in $S$\n",

    "## Theory of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "An *experiment* is a procedure that yields one of a given set of outcomes, e.g. flipping a coin.\n",
    "The *sample space* of an experiment is the set of possible outcomes, e.g. heads or tails.\n",
    "An *event* is any subset of the sample space, e.g. heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a finite sample space $S$, where each outcome is equally likely, the probability of an event $E \\subseteq S$ occuring is \n",
    "$$ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three axioms of probability:\n",
    " - $0 \\leq P(E) \\leq 1$ - the probability of any event occuring is always between 0 and 1\n",
    " - $P(S) = 1$ - the probability that some outcome in the sample space occurs is 1, i.e. the outcome is always in the sample space\n",
    " - For disjoint (mutually exclusive) events $E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n$ (events with no intersection):\n",
    "   - $P(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup E_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other rules can be derived from these:\n",
    " - Complement rule: $P(\\overline{E}) = 1 - P(E)$\n",
    " - Impossible event rule: $P(\\emptyset) = 0$ - the probability of an event that can never occur is 0\n",
    " - General addition rule: $P(E_1 \\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \\cap E_2)$\n",
    " - Subset rule: If $E_1 \\subseteq E_2$, then $P(E_1) \\leq P(E_2)$"
