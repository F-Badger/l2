    "# Data Exploration, Preprocessing, and Problem Framing\n",
    "Machine learning is a method where a computer learns patterns from data so it can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, machine learning consists of using data to create a model, and then to fine-tune it to make better predictions. The predictive model can then be make used to predictions on previously unseen data in order to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns using labeled data - meaning the correct answer is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general flow is:\n",
    "- the machine is provided input data, as well as the correct output for each input\n",
    "- the algorithm makes predictions and compares them with the correct answers\n",
    "- the difference (error) is used to adjust the algorithm\n",
    "- this repeats many times until the machine performs well enough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns, structures, or relationships in data without any labeled output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine is provided unlabelled data as the input data (with no corresponding output), and the algorithm attempts to interpret the data on its own, such as by grouping similar data points together. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent (a computer program) learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general flow is:\n",
    "- the agents takes an action\n",
    "- the environment gives feedback\n",
    "  - positive feedback (reward) is given for good actions\n",
    "  - negative feedback (punishment) is given for bad actions\n",
    "- the agent learns from the feedback\n",
    "  - actions that lead to rewards become more likely in the future\n",
    "  - actions that lead to punishment become less likely\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning requires a balance between exploration (trying new/random actions) and exploitation (using what the agent already knows). If there is too much exploration, the agent's behaviour will be too random; if there is too much exploitation, the agent may miss better strategies. "
