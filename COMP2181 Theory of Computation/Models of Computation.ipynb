    "## Deterministic finite-state automaton\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) is a *finite-state machine* (a mathematical model of computation) that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols by progressing through a state sequence uniquely defined by the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a DFA is defined as a 5-tuple  ($Q, \\Sigma, \\delta, q_0, F$) where:\n",
    " - $Q$ is a finite set of states\n",
    " - $\\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet\n",
    " - $\\delta : Q \\times \\Sigma \\to Q$ is the transition function\n",
    " - $q_0 \\in Q$ is the start state\n",
    " - $F \\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states\n",

    "## Regular languages\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFA $M$ recognises the language $L$ if $L = \\{\\, w \\mid M \\text{ accepts } \\,w\\}$. \n",
    " - The language $L$ is the set of all strings that the DFA $M$ accepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular language is any language that can recognised by some DFA.\n",
    " - If you can build a DFA that accepts exactly the strings in that language, then that language is regular\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression defines a regular language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are built using some basic operations, called regular operations, on languages:\n",
    " - Boolean (set-theoretic) operations - general set operations can be applied to languages, since languages are sets of strings\n",
    "   - Union: $A \\cup B = \\{\\, x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B \\,\\}$\n",
    "   - Intersection: $A \\cap B = \\{\\, x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B \\,\\}$\n",
    "   - Difference: $A \\setminus B = \\{\\, x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B \\,\\}$\n",
    "   - Complement: $\\overline{A} = \\Sigma^{*} \\setminus A$\n",
    " - Language theory specific operations - special to formal languages and regular expressions\n",
    "   - Concatenation: $A \\circ B = \\{\\, xy \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } y \\in B \\,\\}$\n",
    "   - Star: $A^{*} = \\{\\, x_1 x_2 \\dots x_k \\mid k \\ge 0 \\text{ and } x_i \\in A \\text{ for every } i,\\ 1 \\le i \\le k \\,\\} = \\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} A^{i}$\n",

    "The formal definition of a regular expression (RE) is inductive (recursive) - there are iniital REs, and new REs can be obtained from old ones by means of regular operations.\n",

    "Note:\n",
    "- the concatenation symbol can be omitted, i.e. $R_1 R_2$ means $R_1 \\circ R_2$\n",
    "- parenthesis can be omitted, bearing in mind the precedence order from highest to lowest is $^*$, $\\circ$, $\\cup$, i.e. $01 \\cup 1^*$ means $((01) \\cup (1^{*}))$\n",

    "## Combining automata\n",
    "\n",
    "Automata can be combined in order to implement an operation on languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given $L_1$ is recognised by $M_1 = (Q_1, \\Sigma, \\delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $L_2$ is recognised by $M_2 = (Q_2, \\Sigma, \\delta_2, q_2, F_2)$, we can combine $M_1$ and $M_2$ into a new automaton M that would recognise $L_1 \\cup L_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will not work to first simulate the input on $M_1$, then simulate it on $M_2$, and accept if either $M_1$ or $M_2$ or both accept, since after $M_1$ has run on the input, the input is exhausted - A DFA cannot 'rewind' the input in order to run $M_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to run $M_1$ and $M_2$ in parallel, using pairs of states (a state for each DFA). The transition function can be defined as below:\n",
    "![Transition function](parallel_transition_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the components of the new automaton $M = (Q, \\Sigma, \\delta, q_0, F)$ are:\n",
    "- $Q = Q_1 \\times Q_2$\n",
    "- $\\delta((s,u), a) = (\\delta_1(s,a), \\delta_2(u,a)), \\quad \\forall s \\in Q_1, u \\in Q_2, a \\in \\Sigma$\n",
